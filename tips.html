			<h3>Tips & Guides</h3>
            <p>Here are a culmination of Tips & Guides that I learned over the years and find useful.</p>

			<h4>Buy/Sell/Trade Facebook group</h4>
			<p>My favorite Facebook group to purchase 1/6 collectibles from is <u>One Sixth Republic BST</u>. When it comes to purchasing, I usually save somewhere between $50 and $150, and it helps someone who needs quick cash. I generally don't negotiate with the seller for a lower price since the prices within the group are already great. However, I do ask the seller if their asking price includes PayPal Goods & Services and shipping costs.</p>
			<p>When it comes to selling, I always list my price higher than most people's asking price because individuals will often try to negotiate for a lower price. You can't expect people to have the same business ethics as you.</p>

			<h4>Third-Party Companies (Unlicensed)</h4>
			<p>There are many third-party companies trying to fulfill the demand from various fanbases, but the quality and craftsmanship of the collectible figures aren't always on par with licensed companies. However, two third-party companies consistently produce great collectibles at excellent prices, filling gaps that licensed companies often overlook.</p>
			<p>The first company is <u>SooSoo Toys</u>; they understand what consumers want, and their quality rivals that of licensed companies. The second company is <u>Toys-Era</u>; their production choices are much bolder than those of any other licensed or third-party company. I always get extremely excited when I see their new collectible announcements for pre-order on social media.</p>

			<h4>General Maintenance</h4>
			<p>You will want to preserve your expensive figures for as long as possible. Here are a few tips to help extend their lifespan:</p>
			<section>
				<h5>Avoid direction sunlight</h5>
				<p>The direct UV rays will discolor and breakdown the materials of your figure.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>Reset to "Museum Pose."</h5>
				<p>We all enjoy displaying our figures in dynamic action poses, but these can strain the materials over time. I recommend resetting your figure to a “museum pose” within one to two weeks of posing to prevent damage.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h5>Dust Free</h5>
					<p>Keeping your figures free of dust is essential for any collection. To do this, try to find a display case with no openings, ensuring your figures remain 100% dust-free.</p>
					<p>If you choose to display your collectibles in the open, I recommend using a soft-bristle brush to gently remove dust. Many collectors use makeup brushes for this purpose, so consider visiting your local makeup store to find one.</p>
