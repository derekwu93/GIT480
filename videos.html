            <p>Posing with Peter is very creative when it comes to posing his collectibles. He uses resources like bendable wires and fishing lines to create dynamic displays. Try to avoid using the dynamic stands that come with the collectibles, as the clamps can cause damage to the figures over time. Check out his channel as he offers many more creative ideas for your collectibles.</p>

            <p>You must avoid TOYS WONDERLAND at all costs! They advertise pretty good prices on their figures, but they don't actually have the item in stock. The owner, Phillip Lui, has scammed hundreds of people in the 1/6 scale community. I actually lost about $500 shopping with them. Their reputation went downhill after their parter, Justins Collection, finally double-crossed him after about four years of partnership. Phillip has created other websites like "Comic Sanctorum" and "Toys Apollo" to scam more people. As of right now, the rumor is that he has filed for bankruptcy. Be aware!</p>

            <p>Subscribe to "Brother Cousin's" YouTube channel! He offers a large variety of videos within the 1/6 community. He will livestream every pre-order release, official release, and general reviews. He interacts with all of his subcscribers/viewers. He is also a very humble individual.</p>

            <p>I am a huge fan of Cosplay Chris. He is based out of Australia. He is meticulous in all of the custom work that he completes. He even makes 1/1 scale customs for his own costumes/cosplay. He is also fantastic at weathering materials. </p>
